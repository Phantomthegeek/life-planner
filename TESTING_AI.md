## Manual API Testing (Advanced)

### Test Daily Coach API Directly

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/coach \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -d '{"date": "2025-01-15", "mode": "normal"}'
```

**Note:** You need to be authenticated first (sign in via browser)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OPENAI_API_KEY is not defined"
- ✅ Make sure `.env.local` exists
- ✅ Check the key is correct in `.env.local`
- ✅ **Restart your dev server** (environment variables load on start)

### Error: "Unauthorized" 
- You need to be logged in
- Sign in at `/login` first

### Error: "Failed to generate plan"
- Check browser console (F12) for detailed error
- Check server terminal for error logs
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid

### No Response / Loading Forever
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Check internet connection
- Look at browser Network tab for failed requests

---

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Signs:
- Loading spinner appears briefly
- Dialog/modal opens with AI-generated content
- No error messages
- Content is personalized and relevant

### ❌ Failure Signs:
- Error toast notifications
- "Failed to generate" messages
- Console errors about API key
- Blank/empty responses

## Quick Health Check

Run this in your browser console on any dashboard page:

```javascript
// Check if environment is loaded (won't show key, but confirms it's set)
fetch('/api/ai/coach', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], mode: 'normal'})
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('AI Response:', data))
.catch(err => console.error('AI Error:', err))
```
