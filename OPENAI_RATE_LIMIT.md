## 🔍 What This Means

OpenAI has rate limits to prevent abuse:
- **Free tier:** Lower limits (fewer requests per minute)
- **Paid tier:** Higher limits (more requests per minute)

You've made too many requests too quickly.

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Wait and Try Again (Free)

**Just wait a few minutes:**
- Rate limits reset after a short time (usually 1-5 minutes)
- Try again in a few minutes
- Should work then!

### Option 2: Check Your OpenAI Usage

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
2. **Check:**
   - How many requests you've made
   - Your rate limit tier
   - Usage statistics

### Option 3: Upgrade Your OpenAI Account

If you need more requests:

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Add payment method** (if not already)
3. **This increases your rate limits** significantly

### Option 4: Add Retry Logic (I can help with this)

I can add automatic retry with exponential backoff to handle rate limits gracefully.

## ⏰ Quick Fix
