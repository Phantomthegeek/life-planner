# ⚠️ Persistent Rate Limit - Account Issue

## 🔍 What's Happening

You're getting a **500 error with rate limit** even after waiting. This usually means:

1. **Free tier limits** - Very strict (only a few requests per day)
2. **Hit daily quota** - Needs to reset (could be tomorrow)
3. **No payment method** - Limits are very low
4. **Account restrictions** - Need to check account status

## ✅ Fix: Check Your OpenAI Account

### Step 1: Check Usage & Limits

**Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/usage

**Check:**
- How many requests you've made today
- Your usage limits
- If you've hit a quota

### Step 2: Check Rate Limits

**Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits

**See your actual limits:**
- **Free tier:** ~3 requests/minute, ~200 requests/day (very low!)
- **Paid tier:** ~500 requests/minute, much higher daily limits

### Step 3: Check Billing Status

**Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

**Check:**
- ✅ Do you have a payment method added?
- ✅ Do you have credits/budget set?
- ✅ What's your spending limit?

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

**You're probably on the FREE tier with very strict limits.**

### Add Payment Method (Quick Fix)

Even a **$5 budget** dramatically increases your limits!

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Click "Add payment method"**
3. **Add a credit card** (you can set a spending limit like $10/month)
4. **Your rate limits increase immediately!**

**Free Tier:**
- 3 requests/minute
- ~200 requests/day
- Very strict

**With Payment Method (even $5):**
- 500 requests/minute
- Much higher daily limits
- Much more flexible

---

## ⏰ If You Want to Wait

**Daily limits reset at:**
- **Midnight UTC** (could be different time for you)

**Monthly limits reset:**
- First of the month

You might need to wait until tomorrow or check your account to see when limits reset.

## 🔧 Alternative: Try Tomorrow

If you don't want to add payment:
- Wait until tomorrow (limits reset daily)
- Use the AI features more sparingly
- The free tier is quite limited

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Add a payment method** - even with a small budget ($5-10/month), you get:
- ✅ Much higher rate limits
- ✅ Can use AI features freely
- ✅ Can set spending limits to control costs
- ✅ Better experience overall
